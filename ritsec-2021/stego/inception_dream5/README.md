Weâ€™re almost there, we just need Fischer to open the safe! That top looks awfully weird though.

- This challenge works with the image `Inception.jpg` file that you unlock after completing the previous _Dream 4_. To solve this challenge I just ran `strings -n 10 Inception.jpg` on the picture to find the flag encoded in Base64.
